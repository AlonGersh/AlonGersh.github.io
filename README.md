PhD student at [Weizmann Institute of Science](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/pages/)

### Fascinated with stem-cells and their intersection with food science 

I have a Strong background in tissue culture (2D & 3D) and scaffold development. During my, masters I have optimized the  myogenic differentiation of bovine mesenchymal stem cells (bMSCs) and successfully developed cellulose based scaffolds that support their growth and differentiation. I Led from plan to execution a multidisciplinary project under the Israel Innovation Authority's Cultured Meat Consortium and collaborated with academic and industry partners.
